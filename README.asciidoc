Introduction
------------

I set up a local FreeBSD VirtualBox VM to test something and it seems to
work very well. Due to the novelty factor, I decided to get my software
projects to build and pass the tests there.

What I Learned:
---------------

Some executables on FreeBSD are in /usr/local/bin instead of /usr/bin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On Linux they are almost always in +/usr/bin/+

* https://github.com/shlomif/shlomif-computer-settings/blob/master/shlomif-settings/home-bin-executables/bin/fix-perl-shebang.pl[script to fix the perl shebang line]

* +/usr/bin/env+ is your friend.

make on FreeBSD is not GNU make
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* One can use +gmake+

* No +gmake+ on Debian/Ubuntu/etc.
+
* Solution:
+
--------------
mkdir -p ~/bin
ln -sf /usr/bin/make ~/bin/gmake
export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
